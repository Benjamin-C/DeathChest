# DeathChest

DeathChests is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that spawns a chest at your death location with your items rather than dropping them on the ground.
It also adds a /deaths command you can use to see the location of your previous death.

This plugin is currently built for 1.18.2, although it should be able to be built with older versions if you need.
