# DeathChest

DeathChests is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that spawns a chest at your death location with your items rather than dropping them on the ground.

Run `\deaths` to see your latest death location, time, and inventory contents

This plugin is currently built for 1.18.2, although it should be able to be built with older versions if you need. The plugin has been tested and is functional in 1.21.10.
